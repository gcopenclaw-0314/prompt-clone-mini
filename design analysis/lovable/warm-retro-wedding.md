# Warm Retro Wedding — Website Template

![Screenshot](../images/lovable/warm-retro-wedding.jpg)

## Overview
A warm, vintage‑inspired one‑page wedding site with framed panels, soft textures, and classic serif typography. It reads like a printed invitation brought to life: story timeline, event logistics, and a full RSVP form.

## Layout
- **Hero invitation**: “Together with their families” line, couple names, and date block.
- **Our Story**: four framed timeline cards (First Meeting → Proposal) plus a quote and polaroid‑style photo trio.
- **Event Details**: ceremony + reception cards with venue/address and “View on Map” links.
- **Day Schedule**: stacked timeline for ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, dancing.
- **Dress Code**: small callout card.
- **RSVP**: full form (name, email, attendance radio, guests dropdown, dietary, message) + CTA.
- **Footer**: date/location, hashtag, contact email, closing line.

## UX patterns
- Long‑scroll narrative; framed panels guide scanning.
- Clear separation between story, logistics, and response actions.
- RSVP form collects structured info without external tools.

## Animations
Minimal; likely subtle hover states and smooth scroll only. The design relies on print‑like layout rather than motion.

## Visual style
- Warm cream and blush palette with maroon footer.
- Decorative borders, fine lines, and textured background for a retro print feel.
- Elegant serif headings + lighter body text.

## Components
- Invitation hero block
- Timeline cards
- Polaroid image trio
- Detail cards (ceremony/reception)
- Schedule list
- RSVP form + CTA
- Footer info + contact

## Framework/stack (inferred)
- **React / Next.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn/ui** (Cards, Inputs, RadioGroup, Button)

## Prompt cues to recreate
- “Create a vintage wedding one‑pager with framed panels and classic serif typography.”
- “Include a story timeline, event detail cards, day schedule, and full RSVP form.”
- “Use warm cream/blush tones and subtle paper texture; finish with a deep maroon footer.”
