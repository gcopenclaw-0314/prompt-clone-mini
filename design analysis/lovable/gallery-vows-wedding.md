![Screenshot](../images/lovable/gallery-vows-wedding.jpg)

## Overview
A gallery‑inspired wedding site with curatorial language, minimalist typography, and museum‑style navigation. It frames the wedding as an “exhibition,” combining story chronology, curated works, venue, and RSVP.

## Layout
- **Top nav**: “M+E — 2025” badge and section anchors (Exhibition, Chronology, The Works, Venue, RSVP).
- **Hero**: couple names with gallery‑style captioning and date line.
- **Chronology**: vertical story milestones with short, poetic captions.
- **The Works**: curated image grid with exhibit‑style labels.
- **Venue**: location copy, address, map link, and featured venue image.
- **Schedule**: time‑based itinerary cards.
- **Dress code + Photography** notes.
- **RSVP**: simple form with attendance buttons, guest count, dietary notes, message.
- **Footer**: contact email, social handle, hashtag, and back‑to‑top.

## UX patterns
- Section anchor navigation for quick jumping in a long scroll.
- Editorial tone reinforces premium/curated feel.
- Minimalist form to reduce RSVP friction.

## Animations
Likely subtle (hover + anchor scroll). The aesthetic leans static, gallery‑like.

## Visual style
- High‑white space, museum catalog vibe.
- Clean serif/sans pairing with thin rules and understated accents.
- Image tiles labeled like exhibit plaques.

## Components
- Anchor nav bar
- Section headers with sublabels
- Timeline list
- Gallery grid
- Venue card + map link
- Schedule list
- RSVP form + buttons
- Footer contact + hashtag

## Framework/stack (inferred)
- **React / Next.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn/ui**

## Prompt cues to recreate
- “Create a wedding site styled like a contemporary art gallery exhibition.”
- “Use anchor navigation, a chronology timeline, and a curated gallery grid with exhibit labels.”
- “Keep typography minimal and whitespace heavy; add venue, schedule, and RSVP sections.”
