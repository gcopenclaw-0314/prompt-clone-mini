## Overview
A gallery‑first wedding template that emphasizes photography and editorial presentation. The hero preview is minimal and typographic, with the image story living deeper in the layout.

## Layout

- **Features & Capabilities** accordion list.
- **Detailed narrative**: about, audience fit, use cases, setup steps.
- **Related templates + footer**.

## UX patterns
