![Screenshot](../images/lovable/bold-love-wedding.jpg)

## Overview
A bold, poster‑style one‑page wedding site with oversized typography, graphic blocks, and a strong editorial vibe. It’s structured as a narrative story + event details + RSVP flow, designed to feel premium and memorable.

## Layout
- **Hero**: date ribbon, giant couple names, and a short invitation line with a scroll cue.
- **Story section**: large photo + multi‑paragraph story with a 3‑stat row (Years / Adventures / Forever).
- **Details section**: “The I Do’s” + “The Party” cards with icons, time, venue, and address.
- **Dress code callout**: compact alert‑style strip.
- **Moments gallery**: dark section with a photo grid.
- **Calendar highlight**: oversized date treatment (month / day / year) with heart icons.
- **RSVP CTA**: headline, short note, and a mailto‑based “RSVP Now” button.
- **Footer**: initials mark, date/location line, closing note.

## UX patterns
- Long‑scroll narrative with clear section headers for quick scanning.
- Strong visual hierarchy makes key logistics (date/venue) pop.
- Simple RSVP via mailto keeps friction low.

## Animations
Minimal—likely subtle hover states and smooth scroll behavior; the design relies on static graphic impact rather than heavy motion.

## Visual style
- Bold serif display for names + clean sans for body text.
- Cream/pink base with red accents and deep navy gallery section.
- Graphic blocks, ribbons, and divider shapes for poster feel.

## Components
- Hero typography block + date ribbon
- Story card (image + text)
- Stat row (3 KPIs)
- Detail cards (ceremony + reception)
- Callout badge (dress code)
- Gallery grid
- CTA button + footer

## Framework/stack (inferred)
- **React / Next.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn/ui** (buttons, cards, typography)

## Prompt cues to recreate
- “Create a bold, poster‑style wedding one‑pager with oversized serif names and red accent blocks.”
- “Structure sections: Hero → Story + stats → Details cards (ceremony/reception) → Gallery → RSVP.”
