## Overview
A community “hero section” template with an experimental/atmospheric look. The embedded preview suggests a dark scene with floating pill badges (“Made with Midjourney + v0 by …”) and a prominent CTA (“PROMPT”).

## Layout
- **Global v0 shell**: top navigation + auth actions.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Templates → Website Templates → template name.
- **Template header**:
  - Large title (“An unusual hero”)
  - Author + engagement stats + “Free” label
  - Action buttons (like/share) + “Open in v0”
- **Embedded preview**:
  - Dark background/scene
  - Centered inline cluster: “Made with” + pill badges
  - Right-aligned prominent button (“PROMPT”)

## UX patterns
- Experimental hero intended as a starting point for a landing page.
- Primary action inside the hero (“PROMPT”) + standard “Open in v0” CTA outside.
- Social proof and author attribution in the template header.

## Animations
Likely minimal; hover states on pill badges and buttons. If the hero includes ambient motion (e.g., subtle parallax/grain), it’s not clearly visible in the static capture.

## Visual style
- Dark, cinematic hero background.
- Rounded pill badges with outlined styling.
- High contrast CTA button with accent color.
- Minimal chrome; emphasis on mood and typography.

## Components
- Breadcrumb
- Avatar/author row + counters
- Primary button (“Open in v0”) + icon buttons
- Preview frame
- (Inside preview) Pill/Badge components, accent Button

## Framework/stack (inferred)
- Built with **Next.js + React**.
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
- UI primitives likely from **shadcn/ui** (Button, Badge, Card, Breadcrumb).

## Prompt cues to recreate
- “Create a dark, cinematic hero section with centered ‘Made with’ text followed by outlined pill badges (e.g., ‘Midjourney’, ‘v0’, ‘by Webrenew’).”
- “Add a prominent rounded CTA button on the right labeled ‘PROMPT’ with an accent purple/indigo fill.”
- “Use lots of negative space, soft gradients/vignette, and crisp white text on black.”
- “Implement with Next.js/React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui (Badge, Button).”
