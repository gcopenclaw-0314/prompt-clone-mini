## Overview
A component-level template for a branded form page (ACME) featuring a large rounded container with a soft blue background frame. Intended as a reusable form layout (contact, onboarding, application, etc.).

## Layout
- **v0 shell** with breadcrumbs (Templates → Components → …).
- **Template header**: title, author + engagement stats, “Free”, primary “Open in v0”.
- **Embedded preview**:
  - Outer colored backdrop (light blue)
  - Large rounded white panel/card
  - Centered brand mark (“ACME”) near the top
  - Form fields likely continue below the fold.

## UX patterns
- Branded “form-in-a-card” layout with strong containment.
- Likely multi-field form with clear label/input spacing and a single primary submit CTA.
- Large radii and generous padding for a friendly, approachable tone.

## Animations
Minimal—hover/focus states on inputs and buttons; no significant motion.

## Visual style
- Soft, pastel framing background.
- Clean white form surface with extra-large border radius.
- Serif/stylized wordmark for brand emphasis.
- Spacious, editorial layout.

## Components
- Card/surface container
- Brand header/wordmark
- Form primitives: Label, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox/Radio, Button
- Possibly Form validation messaging and helper text

## Framework/stack (inferred)
- **Next.js + React**.
- **Tailwind CSS**.
- **shadcn/ui** form components (Input, Label, Select, Textarea, Checkbox) + Card + Button.

## Prompt cues to recreate
- “Create a branded form page with a pastel blue background and a large rounded white card centered on the page.”
- “Place a centered ‘ACME’ wordmark at the top; below it, add a clean form with labels, inputs, and a primary submit button.”
- “Use generous padding, large border radius, and subtle shadows; implement with Next.js/React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui form primitives.”
